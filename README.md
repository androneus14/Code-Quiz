# Code-Quiz

Our assignment this week was to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that can store high scores so that we can gauge our progress on the topic.

Our initial task was to create an event listener in JavaScript so when we click the start button, a timer for the quiz would start and the user is also presented with a question, and when answered, the next question shows up.

The next task was to subtract time from the clock when the user inputs the incorrect answer, as seen from the image above. Additionally added, was a comment under the quiz, stating whether the user answered correctly or incorrectly, and stating which of the answers was the right one.

Our final task was to create a section where the user can input their initials to record their scores once the quiz is completed.

This was done by implementing what we've just recent learnt about local storage, JSON and appending. Additionally added was new event listeners to create buttons from the high score screen that would take us back to the initial start screen, or to erase the previously recorded high scores.
